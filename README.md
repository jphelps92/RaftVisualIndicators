Visual indicators for the game Raft

### Purpose
In the game Raft, sound effects are important. For instance, sound effects play when the shark bites the raft or when the seagull tries eating plants from your garden. This makes it extra challenging for those who cannot hear or those who are playing with sound turned off.

This mod adds chat notifications whenever the shark attacks the raft or the seagull raids your plants.
